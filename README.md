# Terraform and AWS CLI Docker image

## üì¶ Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

Available image tags can be found on the Docker Hub registry: [cr0nus/aws-box](https://hub.docker.com/r/cr0nus/aws-box/tags)

Supported versions are listed in the [`supported_versions.json`](https://github.com/cr0nus/aws-box/blob/master/supported_versions.json) file in project root folder.

The following image tag strategy is applied:

- `cr0nus/aws-box:latest` - build from master
  - Included CLI versions are the newest in the [`supported_versions.json` ](https://github.com/cr0nus/aws-box/blob/master/supported_versions.json) file.
- `cr0nus/aws-box:release-S.T_terraform-UU.VV.WW_awscli-XX.YY.ZZ` - build from releases
  - `release-S.T` is the release tag
  - `terraform-UU.VV.WWW` is the **Terraform** version included in the image
  - `awscli-XX.YY.ZZ` is the **AWS CLI** version included in the image

Please report to the [releases page](https://github.com/cr0nus/aws-box/releases) for the changelogs.

> Any other tags are not supported even if available.

## üí° Motivation

The goal is to create a **minimalist** and **lightweight** image with these tools in order to reduce network and storage impact.

This image gives you the flexibility to be used for development or as a base image as you see fits.

## üîß What's inside ?

Tools included:

- [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cli/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Terraform remote module usage
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to process JSON returned by AWS
- This image uses a non-root user with a UID and GID of 1001 to conform with docker security best practices.

## üöÄ Usage

### üêö Launch the CLI

Set your AWS credentials (optional) and use the CLI as you would on any other platform, for instance using the latest image:

```bash
echo AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
echo AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
echo AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=YOUR_DEFAULT_REGION

docker container run -it --rm -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" -e "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}" -v ${PWD}:/workspace cr0nus/aws-box:latest
```

> The `--rm` flag will completely destroy the container and its data on exit.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build the image

You can build the image locally directly from the Dockerfiles, using the build script.

It will :

- Lint the Dockerfile with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint);
- Build and tag the image `cr0nus/aws-box:dev`;
- Execute [container structure tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) on the image.

```bash
# launch build script
./dev.sh
```

Optionally, it is possible to choose the tools desired versions :

```bash
# Set tools desired versions
AWS_CLI_VERSION=1.18.189
TERRAFORM_VERSION=0.14.0

# launch the build script with parameters
./dev.sh $AWS_CLI_VERSION $TERRAFORM_VERSION
```
